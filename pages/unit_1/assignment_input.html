    <ol><h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
        <li>Develop code for assignment statements with expressions and determine the value that is stored in the
            variable as a result of these statements. 
            <br/>

            <ul>
                <li>Every variable must be assigned a value before it can be used in an expression. That value must be
                    from a compatible data type. A variable is initialized the first time it is assigned a value.
                    Reference types can be assigned a new object or null if there is no object. The literal null is a
                    special value used to indicate that a reference is not associated with any object.</li>
                <li>The assignment operator = allows a program to initialize or change the value stored in a variable.
                    The value of the expression on the right is stored in the variable on the left.</li>
                <li>During execution, an expression is evaluated to produce a single value. The value of an expression
                    has a type based on the evaluation of the expression.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Develop code to read input.
            <ul>
                <li>Input can come in a variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, or text. The Scanner class is
                    one way to obtain text input from the keyboard.
